The GAP.jpnyb is a good place to interact with the code. You'll typically call 'process' with a function name (as explained in the notebook).
This will prompt for whatever files are needed (input, output, metrical scan file, etc.) The open and save dialogs don't have file-type safeguards --
they will open or overwrite anything. 

GAPinterface contains the ix class that deals with the file system and user interaction
GAPdocumenthelper contains all the code that interacts with the XML structure of a GAP document.
GAPwordhelper contains code that workds on words, syllables, sounds. It doesn't know anything about the XML structure.
GAPscanhandler defines the scanhandler class that iterates over metrical scansion records in a tab-delimited scan file.
